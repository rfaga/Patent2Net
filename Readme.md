About
-----

Patent2Net is elaborated and maintained (on a free base) by a small international team of professors and researchers.  
Patent2Net is a "free" package, dedicated to :

* Augment the use of patent information in academic, nano and small firms, developing countries (all those without pay mode access)
* learn, study and practice how to collect, treat and communicate "textual bibliographic information", and automation process
* provide statistical analysis and representations of a set of patents.

Patent2Net is an "open source" package and contributions are welcome.  
Patent2Net is available "as it is".  
First step : Train how to search patent information using interface

Install Patent2Net package on Windows
-------------------------------------

To run as python script need to install python and some libraries :

* Install python 2.7 x86  from https://www.python.org/
* Update the "path" to python My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > Reboot
* Install pip http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html
* Install requests library : in "C:\Python27\Scripts" open a command windows and run "pip install requests"
* Install networkx library : finding the good way to install in http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/install.html
* Install epo-ops client from gsong on github : https://github.com/55minutes/python-epo-ops-client

Download Patent2Net from https://github.com/Patent2net/Patent2Net unpack where you want on your disk
Use the current version as above

setup.py is provided also to compile binaries for your windows operating system. Use it with the command python setup.py py2exe to produce binaries in the dist directory.

To run as a an exe file (windows) : need to install the "full package", updating can be done only copying the "Patent2Net" files. Operate as a "Command window"


Install Patent2Net on Linux
---------------------------

If you're using Ubuntu or Debian distributions, make sure to have PIP installed:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip

Then, run the requirements.txt file to install all dependencies:

    pip install -r Development/requirements.text

To use the current Development version, you can make a symbolic link to your desired folder:

    ln -sd Development Patent2Net


Use Patent2Net
--------------

1. Edit the file OpsGatherPatentsV2.py and adapt in line 31 the path to you epo accreditation couple: just put in an ASCII file key, password on the same line.
The authenticated credits are obtained from OPS, registering and following instructions.

 1. In the directory make the following directories:
<pre>
    PatentLists 		# will contain files of list of patents
    PatentsBiblio 		# will contain files of bibliographic data
    GephiFilesV5		# will contain gephi files, why V5? Good question my friend.
</pre>

 2. Open a windows command in your Patent2Net directory

2. Construct the patent list and download their bibliography data with OpsGatherPatentsV2.py
	* Use as : ```OpsGatherPatentsV2.py Your_File "search expression"```  
    For example : ```OpsGatherPatentsV2.py test "ti =(stereolithography or \"3D print*\") AND pd<=1996"```  
    Protect the " with a \ Should obtain at minimum as many patents as with the URL interface.  
    Results are stored in the "PatentLists" directory within the dump file in pickle format.      
    Note : OpsGatherPatentsV2.py will gather patents list AND bibliographic data ;-).      
	A new directory "Abstracts" in PatentsBiblio will be created. Guess what it contains.

    * Convert to gephi (gexf) file : PatentsToNet-V5.py Your_File.
	The file is the file produced on stage 1 (without path, PatentsBiblio directory is the default source)
	Result is stored in "GephiFile" directory as a Your_File.gexf.
	Many more features and caracteristics: citations, activeness, and other metrics avalaible.

3. Use the couple OPSGatherAugment-Families to augment Bibliographics data files (created on step one) to the whole families of each patents.
New caracteristics on DYNAMIC and HIERACHIC network will be hence produced thrue PatentsToNet-Families

4. download claims, descriptions, and fulltext if available using OPSGatherContentsv1  (optional, not consistent at this time) : OPSGatherContentsv1.py Your_File

	The file is the file produced on stage 1 (without path, patentlists directory is the default source)  
	Available claims (mainly European Patents EP) will be downloaded and stored "claims" directory


#### Todo List V 1.0 (Beta) 30/10/2014:
	- Future development will add scenaris of analysis (one scenary, one network e.G authors, applicants etc. to avoid the need of Gephi expert's skills)
	- revisiting weight nodes on networks
	- check abstracts gathering (seems lack of content)
	- complete content gathering
	- clean unused function and code everywhere \^\_\^




#### V 0.9 26/03/2014

	URL Links for IPC 7 and 11
	URL Links for inventors or applicant (to evaluate what they are doing out of search field, in general)
	Grouping results in Patent Family.
	Other Gathering process list for family requests
	Susbscribed version.
	Patent Citation
	Revisit weights.

#### V 0.9 26/03/2014

	OpsGather-PatentList
		-Accept an Espacenet "smart search" query
	PatentsToNet
		-fully connected graph is provided in Gephi, connecting any relation (intra and Inter field) : filtering can be done in Gephi or hacking in the Python script.
